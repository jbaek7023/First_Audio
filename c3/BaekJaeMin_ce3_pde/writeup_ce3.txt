* Techniques for ducking
- Setup gain values and controlled gain values in listener and buttons(cp5). 
	- 500 gain value for music
	- 250 gain value for the voice

* Challenges I faced
- First time I used Timeout to delay to volume down the music, but it delayed the whole process, so I couldn't switch to the other voice. 
	- struggled for an hour, then I noticed we can use listener, so I increased the background music in callback.
